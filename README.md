# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks-
This is a machine learning project that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset used for training and testing is the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

# Prerequisites-

This project requires the following Python packages to be installed:

numpy
matplotlib
keras
